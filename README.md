# Member-functions-Car
Given a class named Car containing three properties: the Int property year, the String property make, and the Int property speed.

Add the following member functions to the class:

accelerate adds 5 to the speed property each time it's called;
decelerate subtracts 5 from the speed property each time it's called. The speed cannot be less than zero, so if you get a negative speed, just make it equal to 0.
